# Social_distancing_Indicator

Nowadays, all of us are going through a global pandemic by the virus called “Corona”. It has become mandatory to use sanitizer and maintain social distancing of at least 1 meter. Now, we are going to design a model using Arduino to alert and make people maintain a minimum distance.

	The circuit we are going to design needs Arduino, ultrasonic sensor, pixel ring, breadboard, and a buzzer. We are using a pixel ring for differentiating the distances at each distance. Sensor determines the distance here and buzzer acts as an alarm system. Breadboard is used for connection purpose.

	As soon as the sensor is clicked the circuit starts running. As the distance varies the pixel changes its color such that green says safe, yellow for quite risky, and red for danger. If more distance is reduced the buzzer starts making the sound.
